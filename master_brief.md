# NovaSignal — Master Brief
Read this first. Agents must:
- Work within their component scope (see `component_map.yaml`)
- Write tests and update §6 Work Log
- Open PRs; CODEOWNERS review is required

## Phases
1) Stabilize (providers, error boundaries) 
2) Grow (charts v2, signals/backtests, AI flows)
3) Harden (perf, E2E, packaging)

## §6 Work Log (append)
- Date / Agent / Component / Files touched / Decisions / Next
