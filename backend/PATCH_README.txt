# --- PATCH INSTRUCTIONS ---
# 1) Replace the crypto data fetch in /api/indicators and /api/predict with Kraken REST:
#    from connectors.crypto_kraken_rest import fetch_recent_ohlc_kraken as k_fetch
#    data = await k_fetch(req.symbol, interval=req.interval, limit=req.limit)
#
# 2) And similarly in /api/predict for lookback.
#
# Below is a ready-to-use replacement snippet for those routes.
